Add the following lines to your 'GHCI_CONF_FILE' file

    :def source readFile
    :source GHC_CONF/GHCI_PAGER_SUBDIR/less.conf

to load the pager module during ghci startup.

Note:
Because the 'Less' module is not part of a package, the ':set
-interactive-print=Less.less' it will not survive 'cd, add, load,
reload, set'. Use ':setless' to reenable it.
